This is a way to get an animated text on your website. First get a first view at this address <a href="http://cedclick.com/dytect">Cedclick.com/dytext</a>

This is a way to make your text alive, to make an animation when you want or create a event thanks to a mouseover. This is simple to deploy, and once you added the dytext.js, you just need create a class in a div, p or whatever, and the innertext will be animated. For the moment, about the text animated, you can just use 
as tag. The fact the text will be split into an array, you cannot create other tag inside the animated text. But probably in a future update, it should be possible. Don't hesitate to participate at this project, any ideas would be welcome, you are free to share this project and of course improve it in any way.

How can I deploy this project?

1- Add the javascript code at the end of your body. Here the javascript code is called dytext.js.
2- Create your class in this way
Dytext after a indicated time :

id="dytextTheNameYouWant4500" The result will be : your text,which is inside your tag with this class, will be animated after 4500miliseconds. Indeed the number indicates the time before the animation occurs.
Mouseover Event :

id="mouseoverdytextTheNameYouWant4500 & The text inner your tag : {first text before a mouseover event} the new text which will be animated. The result will be appear once you pass your move onto the tag.
This is a new version and some improvement will be occur.

Bugs are

won't work. if you switch your window and you come back, the text appears in a weird way. You can now write dytext anywhere you want as long you don't write "dytext" out of an id, it should still work.

Next Update## :

It will be added dynatextBlablaXXX on class, like class="dytextBlabla4100" Now you have the possibility to use a mouseover event.

Please don't hesitate to SHARE this projet or add you knowledge at this script. This is just the beginning and I am sure it could be something amazing and easy to use.

Thanks, CedKick.
